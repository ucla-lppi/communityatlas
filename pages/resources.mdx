| [Disparate Disaster Impacts on Undocumented Migrants](https://greatcities.uic.edu/research/disparate-impact-undocumented-migrants/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  | UCI  | “This research project examines how extreme climatic events, such as wildfires, heatwaves, and droughts trigger existing inequalities of socially vulnerable migrants throughout California. It focuses on undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous migrants who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change partly because they experience poverty, have limited English and Spanish proficiency, and fear deportation.”  |
