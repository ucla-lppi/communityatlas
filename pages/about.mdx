Q: How is “Latino” defined?  
A: The Latino Data Hub uses the U.S. government’s official definition of “Latino” to ensure consistency with other data sources. The U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the federal agency that maintains data standards, [defines Hispanic or Latino](https://www.census.gov/topics/population/hispanic-origin/about.html) as “a person of Cuban, Mexican, Puerto Rican, South or Central American, or other Spanish culture or origin regardless of race.” This includes twenty Spanish-speaking countries from Latin America and Spain, but not Portugal or Portuguese-speaking Brazil. While we adopt the federal government’s definition, we recognize the evolving nature of how Latinos identify themselves. The complex nature of pan-ethnic terms makes finding a single identifier most people accept difficult.

### Undocumented Latino population & Climate/health

Research

| Title | Authors | Summary |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Disparate Disaster Impacts on Undocumented Migrants](https://greatcities.uic.edu/research/disparate-impact-undocumented-migrants/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)  | UCI  | “This research project examines how extreme climatic events, such as wildfires, heatwaves, and droughts trigger existing inequalities of socially vulnerable migrants throughout California. It focuses on undocumented Latino/a and Indigenous migrants who are disproportionately vulnerable to climate change partly because they experience poverty, have limited English and Spanish proficiency, and fear deportation.”  |
| [The (in)visible victims of disaster: Understanding the vulnerability of undocumented Latino/a and indigenous immigrants](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32834081/) | Mike Mendez et al | Examines how systemic issues increase these communities' risks during climate disasters. |
| [Air Quality Monitoring and the Safety of Farmworkers in Wildfire Mandatory Evacuation Zones](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38979060/)  | Carlo A Chunga Pizarro et al | This study focuses on Sonoma County, California, investigating the effectiveness of air monitoring and safety protections for farmworkers.  |
